These scripts and patches are to build CyanogenMod (and other ROMs), Multirom, and Multirom enabled TWRP for the Nvidia Shield devices. Currently supported are:

Device Name	Description
------------	---------------
roth		Shield Portable
shieldtablet	Shield Tablet
foster		Shield TV

These scripts expect to be in the script subdirectory of the build area, such as $HOME/carbon-shield/scripts. Then CM would be in $HOME/carbon-shield/cm and the TWRP build directory would be $HOME/carbon-shield/omni_min.

The main build script (build.sh) will clone everything else as needed. Simply clone this repo and run build.sh. After everything is synced and build, the output will be in the uploads directory.

If you wish to build for only specific devices, create or edit devices.txt in this folder and put the device name(s) (one per line) as listed above in there. The scripts will create this file if it doesn't exist and put all available devices in it. If you want to build only cm or twrp/multirom, run 'build.sh cm' or 'build.sh twrp' respectively.

Note: These scripts will overwrite the local manifests every time. If there is an error syncing, run 'rm -rf .repo/manifest*' from that repo directory and the scripts will set everything back up.

If you wish to add patches:
1. Copy patch into scripts/patches
2. Add a line to the appropriate patches.txt
  a) patches_cm.txt applies to all cm builds
  b) patches_cm_${device}.txt applies to only that device for cm builds
  c) patches_twrp.txt applies to all twrp/multirom builds
  d) patches_twrp_${device}.txt applies to only that device for twrp/multirom builds
  e) Format is '${patch_name}	${relative_path}' (tab in between, see patches_cm.txt for an example)
